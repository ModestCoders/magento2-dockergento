### Upgrade steps
1. Create a backup of your current config:
	
	```
	mv config/dockergento config/dockergento-backup
	mv docker-compose.yml docker-compose.yml.backup
	```

2. Run `dockergento setup` inside your project
3. Edit volumes in `docker-compose.dev.mac.yml` as you had it before. 
4. Edit `nginx` configuration in `config/dockergento/nginx/conf/default.conf`
5. Edit `config/dockergento/properties` if needed.

## [2.1.0] - 21-09-2018
### Changed

* Easier install documentation using `dockergento setup` command
* Set all configuration settings inside `config/dockergento` folder
* Change `docker-compose.yml` filename to `docker-compose.sample.yml` as this file needs to be copied and edited per project.

## [2.0.0] - 13-09-2018
### Changed

* Set whole magento application in a named volume `magento` instead of using 6 volumes:

	```
	app-vendor
	app-generated
	app-var
	pub-static
	pub-media
	integration-test-sandbox
	```

    * Reason: Bug when having volumes inside a file bind mount: [#26157](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/26157#issuecomment-419722589)

## [1.3.0] - 05-09-2018
### Changed
* Documentation about how to sync `vendor` and `generated` volumes according to latest changes on [magento2-dockergento-console](https://github.com/ModestCoders/magento2-dockergento-console) 

### Removed

* Remove first 2 steps to configure xdebug in PHPStorm are not longer needed because it is enough by just setting the debug port and server configuration
* Remove bind mount of `generated` folder in `unison container. Unison container is now only meant to be used for `watch` command inside vendor modules.

## [1.2.0] - 30-08-2018
### Added

* Development workflow documentation
* Troubleshooting section with info about broken volumes

### Changed

* Use updated node image with right user `app` by default
* Use `modestcoders/php` image
* Xdebug uses now `xdebug.remote_host=host.docker.internal` as it is defined on `modescoders/php` images

### Removed

* Remove not needed `NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX` because default user is now app
* Remove phpstorm xdebug `DBGp` configuration step that is no longer needed

## [1.1] - 24-08-2018
### Changed

* Use `modestcoders/unison:2.51.2` image for unison container
* Update `markoshust/magento-php` images to PHP `7.1` using tag `7.1-fpm-3`
* Update docker setup with fixes for node and integration tests
* Update dependencies and `app-volumes` configuration to avoid issues when `app-volumes` is started several times in same `docker-compose up` execution
* Execute Dockerfile run commands for `app-volumes` in only one layer as it is best practise
* Update README with `node` and `unison` commands to use `run` instead of `exec`
* Update `xdebug + phpstorm` documentation

## [1.0.1] - 15-08-2018
### Changed
